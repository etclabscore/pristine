# generator-docs

Baseline markdown generator. At the moment, this repo ONLY GENERATES MARKDOWN FILES.

The markdown files are language agnostic. They are ONLY a pretty representation of the raw data already in the schema file.

Next steps:
1. awareness of client generators
2. examples that run in-docs
