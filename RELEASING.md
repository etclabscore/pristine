The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [BCP 14](https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp14) [RFC2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119) [RFC8174](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8174) when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

When using the name 'version' we mean the versioning scheme described in [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md)

## Introduction

This document is to describe the release pipeline, which is taking the result of the artifacts created in the [building step](BUILDING.md) and publish a release to the various release targets for the project.

We propose:
 - a set of release targets that are allowable
 - a pipeline for handling the release folder's artifacts

It is NOT the purpose of this document to describe how a project might create a build, NOR is it describing a strcture in which a project MUST write build artifacts to. It is describing the structure of the releases themselves, however.

## Release Targets
1. github
2. (tentative) docker

## Release Pipeline
The only parameter to the release pipeline is the new semver to use. We will refer to it as newVer.
Starting from a clean branch:

### Create a build from current branch
Process is outlined in [the BUILDING spec](building.md)
in summary, we will simply:
1. Clean the build directory
2. run: `docker-compose up -f ./docker-compose.build.yml`

### Sign the releases.
 - MUST be a pgp signature
 - MUST be the same pgp key as is registered with github
 - MUST be a detached signature
 - All files in the build folder MUST have an associated signature file

### Generate Changelog
For our projects we will be using [conventional changelog](https://github.com/conventional-changelog/conventional-changelog).

1. Generate the changelog. EX: `conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s -r 0`
2. git add the changelog diff: `git add CHANGELOG.md`

### Bump the version of the project
This is project specific.

use the convention outlined by [VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md):
 - `bin/bump-version.sh {newVer}`

### Commit the bump + changelog update
generate a commit with the changes.

### Push changelog & version bump
simple as `git push`.

### Run Release Targets
For each of the desired release targets, prepare and push the release.

#### Github Release
Using [github release tool](https://github.com/c4milo/github-release), push a release with the following fields:


| Field name       | Content                                                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| tag version      | {newVer}                                                       |
| title            | same as tag                                                    |
| description      | {changelog for specific version}                               |
| release binaries | for each platform: `{project-name}-{platform}-{version}.{ext}` |
